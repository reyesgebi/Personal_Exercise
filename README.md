# Gabriel's Personal Project

Hello, I have just started my data science journey in 2022. This repository contains my personal work on data science project.





## 1. Credit Default

**Dataset**

I am using a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/loan-default-dataset). It has **148670** entries of data and contains 34 columns that describe each unique customer within the dataset.

**Project Objective**

I am using Supervised Learning method to determine whether a customers will defaulting their credit card. I am accounting 4 algorithm that possibly works for the clasification within this dataset, and the hyperparameter is also searched through Hyperparameter Tuning.

## 2. Credit Default 2.0

**Dataset**

I am using a dataset from [BigQuery](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?p=bigquery-public-data&d=ml_datasets&t=credit_card_default&page=table). It has **2.965** entries of data and contains 24 columns that describe each unique customer within the dataset.

**Project Objective**

I am accounting 7 classification algorithm that possibly works for the clasification within this dataset, and the hyperparameter is also searched through Hyperparameter Tuning. I also use cross validation technique to pick the most optimum algorithm to be deployed

## 3. Country Clustering

I am using a dataset from Kaggle. It has **167** entries of data and contains 10 columns that describe each unique attributes from each country within the dataset.

**Project Objective**

I am using unsupervised learning and KMeans Algorithm to clusterize countries and choose destination countries which put into the top priority for an NGO's finanical assistance.

## 4. Ride Hailing Price Forecasting

I am using a dataset from Kaggle. It has **693.071** entries of data and contains 57 columns that describe each unique trip.

**Project Objective**

I am using supervised learning, linear regression algorithm to determine the ride price based on the most influencing features.
